## Services

This is the GitHub organization for Cabin Development LLC - we're a software development company based out of Los Angeles, CA. We build software for businesses.

While the team has, and will continue to, perform contract software development work via [HurdleHare](https://www.hurdlehare.com/), we're also developing our first software as a service! More to come.

### [HurdleHare](https://www.hurdlehare.com/): Custom software, built for your business

- **Custom Software Development**: web applications, mobile apps, and the services that power them
- **Technical Consulting**: expert guidance on navigating the software landscape
- **Artificial Intelligence**: integrations with LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude
- **Data Solutions**: data gathering, storage, and analysis to drive informed business decisions
- **Integrations**: connections with third-party APIs and services
- **Project Management**: sprint planning, tracking, and execution to ensure timely delivery

Though we've helped build startups, we specialize in working with established businesses. Our clients typically have an established workflow. We'll start by sitting in on meetings and learning how the business operates. We're looking for three things:

1. **Repetition**: A smart business owner has already taken steps to automate repetitive tasks - but if the solution still requires a team member's input, it's costing you more time than you think.
2. **Context Switching**: If a task takes 5 minutes or less, it's a strong candidate for automation. The average person takes 23 minutes to get back on track after an interruption; there's a significant amount to gain by removing the task from the team member's plate entirely.
3. **Impact**: Depending on the relevance of the task to the company's core value offering, it may be more reasonable to outsource the task or discontinue support for it entirely.

I am lucky to be passionate about my work; though Cabin Development LLC is a for-profit business, I'm happy to chat about your project even if it doesn't make sense for us to work together.
