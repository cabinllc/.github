## Custom software, built for your business

Though we've helped build startups, we specialize in working with established businesses. Our clients typically have an established workflow. We'll start by sitting in on meetings and learning how the business operates. We're looking for three things:

## Repetition

> [!WARNING]
> A smart business owner has already taken steps to automate repetitive tasks - but if the solution still requires a team member's input, it's costing you more time than you think.

## Context Switching

> [!TIP]
> If a task takes 5 minutes or less, it's a strong candidate for automation. The average person takes 23 minutes to get back on track after an interruption; there's a significant amount to gain by removing the task from the team member's plate entirely.

## Impact

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Depending on the relevance of the task to the company's core value offering, it may be more reasonable to outsource the task or discontinue support for it entirely.
